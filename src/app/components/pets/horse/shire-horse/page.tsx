                towering height and **gentle temperament**. Originating in England, Shires were historically used for 
                **heavy farm work** and **draft purposes**. These impressive horses are famous for their strong, muscular

                farm work, and even participation in horse shows. Shires have a loyal following due to their **gentle giants** 
                nature, making them wonderful companions.
