                The **Pahari Goat** is a **hardy and versatile breed** found in the **hilly and mountainous regions** of 
                Pakistan. Known for their **strong constitution** and ability to adapt to harsh climates, these goats 
                are highly valued by farmers and breeders alike.
                
                Pahari goats are excellent for **meat production**, with their meat being **tender and flavorful**. They 
                are also good milk producers, though their primary value lies in their **robust health** and ability to 
                thrive in difficult environments. They can produce **1-2 liters of milk per day**, which is perfect for 
                local dairy needs.
                
                These goats are **medium-sized**, agile, and able to travel long distances in rugged terrains. Their 
                **thick coats** help protect them in cold weather, making them a suitable choice for farmers in **mountainous** 
                or **rough terrain** areas.
                
                If you are looking for a **resilient and adaptable goat** that can thrive in challenging conditions, the 
                Pahari Goat is a great choice for your farm! üêê‚ú®
